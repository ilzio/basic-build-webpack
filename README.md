# basic-build-webpack

Very basic webpack configuration for 
- bundling scss and transforming it into css 
- bundling javascript modules
- dinamically creating html from template, injecting assets + adding hash for cash busting

Also contains configurations for development purposes:
- webpack dev-server
- custom express server 

This is far from being a complete project, indeed, it is intended as a sort of documentation for building more complicated stuff in the foreseeable future.
